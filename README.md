# PCC_Coding_Challenge_Pong


To run the program there are a few prerequisites:
1. Python 3.7.3 (x86-64) must be installed (Python 2.7 can work as well. Requires a minor edit in code.
2. PySimpleGUI must be installed (`pip install --upgrade PySimpleGUI`)

Once the prerequisite's have been installed, the "Main.Py" file can be run to play the game. 



*Note: 
- Only tested on Windows 10 (build 18362.175).
- Due to the features of PySimpleGUI, the program can be easily adapted (just by changing the import statement) to run on other platforms such as:  tkinter, Qt, WxPython, Remi (in browser)
